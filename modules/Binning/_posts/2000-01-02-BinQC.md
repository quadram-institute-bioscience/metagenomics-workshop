# Part 1: Binning Quality Control

---

## Overview

In this section, you'll learn to assess bin quality using two complementary tools:
- **Tiara** - Classifies sequences as bacterial, archaeal, or eukaryotic
- **CheckM2** - Assesses completeness and contamination of bacterial/archaeal bins

These tools answer different questions and reveal different types of contamination. Together, they provide a comprehensive view of bin quality.

## Quality Assessment

Not all bins are created equal. Some represent nearly complete genomes while others are fragments or chimeras mixing multiple organisms. Quality assessment is critical before using MAGs for downstream analyses.

### Completeness and Contamination

**Completeness** estimates what percentage of the genome is present, measured by checking for expected single-copy marker genes. A set of genes that should appear exactly once in every genome is used as a reference. If 95 out of 100 expected markers are found, the MAG is ~95% complete.

**Contamination** estimates whether multiple genomes are mixed together, measured by checking for duplicated single-copy marker genes. If marker genes appear more than once, it suggests sequences from multiple organisms were binned together. For example, finding the same ribosomal protein gene three times indicates potential contamination from three organisms.

**Important:** These are *estimates* based on universal marker genes, not perfect measurements. Novel organisms may lack expected markers (underestimating completeness), and true gene duplications can look like contamination.

### MIMAG Quality Standards

The community has established standards for MAG quality (Bowers et al. 2017):

| Quality Tier | Completeness | Contamination | Additional Requirements |
|--------------|--------------|---------------|------------------------|
| **High** | >90% | <5% | 23S, 16S, 5S rRNA; ≥18 tRNAs |
| **Medium** | ≥50% | <10% | - |
| **Low** | <50% | <10% | - |

Most downstream analyses require at least medium-quality MAGs. High-quality MAGs are rare but extremely valuable as they represent near-complete genomes comparable to isolate genomes.

### CheckM2: Quality Assessment Tool

**CheckM2** uses machine learning to estimate MAG quality rapidly and accurately. It supports bacteria and archaea (separate marker sets), is faster than the original CheckM (~10x speedup), and works well even for novel organisms divergent from reference databases. CheckM2 will be used in this workshop to assess bin quality.

## Sequence Classification with Tiara

Metagenomic samples often contain sequences from multiple domains of life. Coffee fermentation includes bacteria (our target), yeasts (eukaryotic, biologically relevant), and plant DNA (eukaryotic, contamination from coffee beans).

### Why Classify Sequences?

**CheckM2 is designed for bacteria and archaea.** If bins contain eukaryotic sequences (yeasts or plant DNA), CheckM2 may report spurious results or high contamination. Tiara helps identify which bins are truly bacterial versus eukaryotic or mixed, explaining why some bins have unexpected CheckM2 results.

### What is Tiara?

**Tiara** is a deep learning tool that classifies DNA sequences into: bacteria, archaea, eukarya (eukaryotes), organelle (mitochondria, plastids), and unknown (ambiguous sequences). It's fast (seconds per bin), works on assembled contigs, and helps identify contamination sources.

### Types of Contamination

Understanding sequence composition reveals different contamination types:

**Eukaryotic contamination** - Yeast or plant sequences mixed with bacteria. CheckM2 will be confused (looking for bacterial markers in eukaryotic sequences).

**Bacterial-bacterial mixing** - Multiple bacterial species binned together. CheckM2 detects this as high contamination (duplicated bacterial markers).

**The key insight:** CheckM2 contamination and Tiara "Mixed" classification represent different types of contamination. You need both tools to understand bin quality fully.

## Hands-On: Running Tiara

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Activate Tiara environment
conda activate tiara

# Verify installation
tiara -h
```

### Understanding Tiara Usage

```bash
tiara -i INPUT.fa -o OUTPUT.txt --threads N
```

**Key parameters:**
- `-i` or `--input` - Input FASTA file (your bin)
- `-o` or `--output` - Output classification file
- `--threads` - Number of threads to use
- `-m` or `--min_len` - Minimum contig length (default: 1000)

### Demo: Running Tiara on Example Bins

**Follow along as the instructor demonstrates Tiara on different bin types.**

The instructor will show:
1. A clean bacterial bin (>80% bacteria)
2. A eukaryotic bin (>80% eukarya)
3. A mixed/contaminated bin (bacteria + eukarya)

### Tiara Output Format

Tiara produces a tab-delimited file:

```
sequence_id classification probability
contig_001  bacteria 0.98
contig_002  bacteria 0.95
contig_003  eukarya  0.87
...
```

**Columns:**
- `sequence_id` - Contig name
- `classification` - Predicted class (bacteria/archaea/eukarya/organelle/unknown)
- `probability` - Classification confidence (0-1)

## Exploring Results in R

### Open RStudio and Load Data

**[Link to R Markdown: Tiara and CheckM2 Exploration](LINK_TO_TIARA_CHECKM2_RMD)**

In this R session, you'll:
1. Load pre-computed Tiara results for all bins
2. Visualize bin composition (bacteria vs eukarya)
3. Classify bins as "Bacterial", "Archaeal", "Eukaryotic", or "Mixed"
4. Load CheckM2 quality metrics
5. Merge Tiara and CheckM2 data
6. Investigate: Does eukaryotic content explain CheckM2 contamination?

### Key Questions to Explore

**Q1:** How many bins are predominantly bacterial (>80% bacteria)?

**Q2:** How many bins have significant eukaryotic content (>20% eukarya)?

**Q3:** Do eukaryotic bins have high CheckM2 contamination?

**Q4:** Do "Mixed" bins (bacteria + eukarya) have high CheckM2 contamination?

### The Key Insight

**CheckM2 and Tiara detect different types of contamination:**

**CheckM2 contamination** - Detects bacterial-bacterial mixing (duplicated bacterial markers)

**Tiara "Mixed" classification** - Detects bacterial-eukaryotic mixing (bacteria + yeast/plant DNA)

**Important finding:** Mixed bins (bacteria + eukarya) often have LOW CheckM2 contamination because CheckM2 only analyzes the bacterial portion and ignores eukaryotic sequences!

## CheckM2: Bacterial/Archaeal Quality Assessment

### What is CheckM2?

CheckM2 estimates completeness and contamination for bacterial and archaeal genomes using machine learning trained on universal single-copy marker genes.

### Understanding the Metrics

**Completeness (%):**
- Percentage of expected marker genes found
- Higher = more complete genome
- 100% = all expected genes present

**Contamination (%):**
- Percentage of unexpected marker gene duplications
- Single-copy genes should appear exactly once
- Duplications suggest multiple genomes mixed together
- Higher = more contaminated

**MIMAG Quality Tiers:**
- **High:** >90% complete, <5% contamination
- **Medium:** 50-90% complete, <10% contamination
- **Low:** <50% complete, <10% contamination
- **Poor:** ≥10% contamination (regardless of completeness)

### What CheckM2 Tells Us

**High completeness, low contamination** - Good quality MAG, likely single organism

**Low completeness, low contamination** - Incomplete MAG, but what's there is clean

**High contamination** - Multiple organisms mixed, or strain heterogeneity

**Low completeness, high contamination** - Poor quality, likely unusable
