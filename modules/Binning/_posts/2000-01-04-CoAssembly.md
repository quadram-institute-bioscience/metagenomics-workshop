# Independent Exploration: Comparing Individual vs Co-assembly Approaches

---

## Overview

Now it's your turn! You'll use the same R analysis workflows to explore MAGs generated from co-assembly and compare them with the individual assembly results we examined together.

**The Workshop material** is available to download in [Figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/presentation/MMB_DTP_workshop_-_Introduction_to_binning_of_metagenomes/30724289)

## Your Task

Using the R Markdown documents from the previous sessions, analyze the co-assembly bins and compare the two approaches:

## Key Questions to Answer

Work through the same analyses, but now comparing individual assembly vs co-assembly:

1. **Quality comparison** - Which approach produced higher quality MAGs?

2. **Taxonomic diversity** - Which approach recovered more families? More species?

3. **Contamination patterns** - Does co-assembly have more contamination? Why?

4. **Representative MAGs** - Which approach contributed more to the final dereplicated set?

5. **Target organisms** - Which approach better recovered important coffee fermentation taxa (Lactobacillaceae, Acetobacteraceae)?

6. **Your recommendation** - Based on your findings, which assembly strategy would you recommend for coffee fermentation studies?

## Prepare to Share

Be ready to discuss:
- Your recommendation (individual, co-assembly, or both)
- Key evidence supporting your choice
- One interesting finding from your comparison
