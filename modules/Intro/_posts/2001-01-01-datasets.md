## Coffee dataset

📜 From [Pothakos 2020](https://cris.vub.be/ws/portalfiles/portal/70637346/1_s2.0_S2590262820300034_main.pdf) "_Temporal shotgun metagenomics of an Ecuadorian coffee fermentation process highlights the predominance of lactic acid bacteria_"

This study presents a temporal shotgun metagenomic analysis of an Arabica wet coffee fermentation process conducted at a coffee plantation research station near *Nanegal*, Ecuador (elevation 1329 m). 
The project was designed to complement previous microbiological and metabolomic studies of the same fermentation process by providing an in-depth, genome-level analysis of the microbial community structure and functional capabilities. The research examined reproducible wet coffee processing practices, where ripe coffee cherries 
(_Coffea arabica_ L. var. Typica) were mechanically depulped and fermented underwater in a concrete tank (1 m × 2 m × 2 m).

The primary objectives were to delineate the **structure and function of the microbiome**, 
investigate temporal shifts in community composition, 
track microbial sources from the plantation environment, 
identify core and transient microbiota, and determine the metabolic roles of distinct microbial species during fermentation. 

The study generated approximately 54 million high-quality metagenomic sequences representing 16 Gbp of data, which were analyzed following removal of ~8 million plant DNA sequences from _Coffea canephora_.
