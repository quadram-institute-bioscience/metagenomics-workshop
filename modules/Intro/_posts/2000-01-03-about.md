title: About this workshop

This workshop focuses on showing a simplified workflow
to mine phages in a metagenome.

Starting from reads, we need to do some quality filtering and assembly to get contigs.

In a simplified workflow:

We will start with the co-assembly of three samples, so we will use:

1. A viral miner tool to predict viral sequences in a metagenome (**geNomad**), that will produce a FASTA file with viral sequences and prophages
2. A program to check the quality of the predictions (**checkV**), will give us a report on each prediction checking for bacterial contamination, completeness, and a score based on marker genes.
3. To produce **vOTUs** (Viral Operational Taxonomic Units) we will **dereplicate** the viral sequences
4. We will rename the sequences with **SeqFu** to make them Anvi'o friendly

To keep our Anvi'o love high, we can also:

1. Back-map the reads to the vOTUs to estimate their abundance in the original samples with **MiniMap2** and **samtools**
2. Use Anvi'o to generate a visualization focused on the vOTUs, building a CONTIGS.db database only based on the candidate vOTUs.

## EBAME settings

We will use VMs provided by Biosphere, and with a setup script datasets and databases will be automatically available.
