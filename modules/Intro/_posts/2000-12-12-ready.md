If you followed this introductory section, you should:

1. Have a `$VIROME` variable set to the path of the data, so that you  should see the input files if you:

```bash
ls -l $VIROME
```

2. Have `seqfu` running in your VM:

```bash
seqfu version
```

3. Preferably, use tmux to keep the session safe from network glitches.
