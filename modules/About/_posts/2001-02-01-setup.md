### Suggested readings

- **"Metagenomic approaches in microbial ecology: an update on whole-genome and marker gene sequencing analysis" (2020, PMC7641418)**  
  This relatively recent review offers a detailed introduction to metagenomics with a strong emphasis on analysis pipelines for both whole-genome and marker gene data, covering best practices, comparisons of tools, and guidelines[1]

- **"Introduction to Metagenomics: Tools, Workflows & Insights" (2025, RNA-seq Blog)**  
  A good blog post with a broad overview that bridges conceptual foundations with practical workflows, describing sequencing technologies, data analysis strategies, and examples of ecological discoveries[2]

- **"Genome-resolved metagenomics: a game changer for microbiome studies" (2024, Nature Cell Biology)**  
  This review explains the transition from traditional methods to genome-resolved metagenomics, highlighting its impact on human microbiome research with approachable explanations for students.[3]

- **"Metagenomics - a guide from sampling to data analysis" (2012, PMC3351745)**  
  An accessible primer (a bit outdated), this article provides a clear step-by-step guide from sampling through data analysis, discussing both functional and phylogenetic aspects with practical examples.[4]
 
- **"Metagenomics: An Effective Approach for Exploring Microbial Diversity" (2023, PMC10252221)**  
  Focused on applications in human microbiome research, this review is easy to follow and discusses technological advances, pipelines, and key databases relevant for analysis.[6]
