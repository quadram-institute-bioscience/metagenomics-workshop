In this example, we’ll write a script that displays the first 10 lines of a gzipped file and call it `zhead`.

When we execute any command, we’re actually running a program — and a program is just a file.
For instance, the `ls` command is usually located at `/usr/bin/ls`. So why can we use it from anywhere?

That’s because when we type a command, the shell searches for it in the directories listed in the `$PATH` environment variable.
This variable is a **colon-separated list of directories** that the shell scans to locate executables.
If it finds the command in one of those directories, it runs it; otherwise, it shows an error.

To see the content of your `$PATH` variable:

```bash
echo $PATH
```

You’ll see a list of directories separated by colons. These are the directories your shell searches for commands.

💡 To display them as a list, you can use `sed` to replace colons with newlines:

```bash
echo $PATH | sed 's/:/\n/g'
```


## 1. Create the script

Let’s create the script in your home directory:

```bash
nano ~/zhead
```

In the **nano** editor, add the following content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if a filename was supplied
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Error: No file supplied"
    echo "Usage: zhead <gzipped-file>"
    exit 1
fi

gzip -dc "$1" | head
```

* ⚠️ **Shebang line (`#!`)** — must be the first line of the script, with no spaces after `#!`.
  It tells the system which interpreter to use. Here, `/bin/bash` specifies Bash.
* The `if` statement checks whether an argument was provided; if not, it shows an error and exits.
* The `gzip` command decompresses the gzipped file and pipes the result to `head`, which displays the first 10 lines.

Press `Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, and `Enter` to save and exit.

## 2. Create the `~/bin` directory

We’ll place the script in a personal `bin` directory inside your home folder - where you have write permissions.
(Remember: `~` is shorthand for your home directory.)

If it doesn’t exist already, create it:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/bin
```



## 3. Move the script to `~/bin`

Move the script into the `bin` directory:

```bash
mv ~/zhead ~/bin/
```

If you try to execute it now:

```bash
~/bin/zhead
```

You’ll likely get a **“Permission denied”** error because the file isn’t executable yet.

Check its permissions:

```bash
ls -l ~/bin/zhead
```

Example output:

```bash
-rw-r--r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 123 Oct 19 10:00 /home/ubuntu/bin/zhead
```

The first part shows the [file permissions](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/linux-file-permissions-explained):

* `r` = readable
* `w` = writable
* `x` = executable

There’s no `x` in the example, so it’s not executable yet.
(If the first character is `d`, it means the entry is a directory.)



## 4. Make the script executable

Add execute permissions for the user (the file’s owner):

```bash
chmod u+x ~/bin/zhead
```

Verify the change:

```bash
ls -l ~/bin/zhead
```

Example output:

```bash
-rwxr-xr-x 1 ubuntu ubuntu 123 Oct 19 10:00 /home/ubuntu/bin/zhead
```

Now the script has execute (`x`) permission.

 

## 5. Add `~/bin` to your `$PATH`

Check whether `~/bin` is already part of your `$PATH`:

```bash
echo $PATH
```

If you don’t see `/home/ubuntu/bin` or `~/bin` in the list, you’ll need to add it.

Edit your `.bashrc` file:

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

Add this line at the end:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME"/bin:"$PATH"
```

Press `Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, and `Enter` to save and exit.

 

## 6. Refresh your shell settings

Apply the changes without logging out:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

 

## 7. Verify the changes

Check again:

```bash
echo $PATH
```

You should now see `/home/ubuntu/bin` (or `~/bin`) at the **start** of your `$PATH`.

 
## 8. Test the script

Try running it:

```bash
zhead
```

You should see:

```bash
Error: No file supplied
Usage: zhead <gzipped-file>
```

Now test it with a gzipped file:

```bash
zhead /path/to/your/gzipped/file.gz
```

This should display the first 10 lines of the uncompressed file.

✅ **Success!** You’ve created a script and made it globally accessible through your `$PATH`.
